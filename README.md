Today, I've being told that my mother was caught by the new coronavirus.
I am worried about her so much cuz she is a doctor in the hospital in Wuhan.
But I can not go home and even if I could, I can not come back to Tokyo.
I am so ashamed because I am not staying together with her.

For my mother, I know it's her duty to save other's lifes at the risk of her own life, but let's suppose that if the thing came to you, you must hesitate for a while, won't you? Her choice makes her personality even greater, not only as a doctor, also as a human being.  

Anyway, I hope she can get recovered.
To be continued.
